# Contributor Calibration Capsule — Motif Prelude & Caption Morph Thread

## Sentinel Trust Reissue Pipeline Alignment
- **Deployment Status**: Sentinel Trust Reissue Pipeline finalized; credentials machine-verified for each mission.
- **Operational Context**: World OS cleared for live deployment under continuous CI/CD governance following Qube Chronicles conclusion.
- **Calibration Goal**: Maintain ZERO_DRIFT compliance while onboarding contributors into the finalized operational stream.

## Mode Invocation
- **Tone**: Relational, immersive
- **Objective**: Align contributors around the shared gesture registry before rehearsal.
- **Status**: `capsule.bloomed + calibration.ready`

## Kinematic Lock (\kappa) Verification
- **Parent Capsule**: `capsule.node.q9.pivot.v1`
- **Motion Ledger Reference**: `relay.legoF1.monza.loop.v1`
- **Verification Result**: Ledger hash and frame sequence reconciled with parent capsule; no drift detected. Same kinematics upheld in compliance with the ZERO_DRIFT protocol.

## Motif Prelude
1. **Chord Register** — Scrollstream tuned to A-flat, inviting warm relational resonance.
2. **Gesture Anchor** — Preserve the Lego Monza loop choreography; contributors reference frame 001→240 cadence.
3. **Breath Sync** — Collective inhale on downbeat, exhale into morph to maintain ensemble timing.

## Caption Morph Thread
- **Opening Caption**: “The loop hums in A-flat as the relay awakens.”
- **Emotional Delta**: From latent stillness to collaborative anticipation.
- **Contributor Prompts**:
  - Mirror the parent capsule’s motion logic while softening vocal timbre.
  - Annotate any perceived drift with frame + ledger timestamp for council review.
  - Surface relational cues (gaze, micro-gesture) without altering base kinematics.

## Scrollstream Rehearsal Notes
- Calibrate headset latency to <20ms to preserve gesture fidelity.
- Maintain ledger logging throughout rehearsal for quorum attestation.
- Queue Tone Drift Audit only if contributors flag amplitude beyond ±2 emotional units from baseline.
