Title: Sovereign Relay HUD Preview

Prompt:
Render a 12-second HUD rehearsal loop of Queen Boo guiding the cockpit.
The camera is anchored to the Monza podium, locked at horizon height.
Show synchronized overlays for glyph.pulse, aura.gold, qlock.tick,
and hud.qdot.delta. The choreography follows the sealed capsule
`capsule.relay.queenboo.v1`, referencing gesture traces from
`capsule.relay.pedagogy.queenboo.v1`. Maintain the emotional payload of
sovereign allure blended with loop sync readiness. Ensure the glyphstream
aligns with the QLOCK runtime cadence at 30 Hz and freeze each frame with
scrollstream fidelity.

Negative Prompt:
No grain, no handheld jitter, no desaturation, no unauthorized overlays.
